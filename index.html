            Why another site?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the only site on the internet that walks a complete beginner all the way through the process of developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals. Everyone wants to start learning, but very quickly they realize that there is no set path for them to follow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people will say that is a good thing and that everyone should learn their own way. <b>We strongly disagree</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            By providing a clearly defined first step and the way forward from there, our students graduate with the knowledge they need of the fundamentals, a firm grasp on the hacker mentality, and the confidence that they can learn anything if they put the time in.

        <h2>
            Roppers Academy Core Tenets:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No initial expectation of knowledge</li>
            <li>Understanding foundational theory comes before building technical skills</li>
            <li>Developing fundamental technical skills lays the groundwork for future success</li>
            <li>Knowledge must be actionable</li>
            <li>There is no “I Believe” button</li>
            <li>The measure of a community is how they treat those who are trying to gain entry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
